Its exclusion from predominant art historical narratives could well be due to the complex nature of photographs themselves, tied up simultaneously as a mode of documentation and artistic production. The potential of the medium gives rise to inherent contradictions that might be perceived as obstacles to a singular, coherent narrative.</p>\n<p><em>Living Pictures</em> confronts the complexities of photography head-on. It traverses the character of each individual image to take a wider view of photography, shifting the general tenor of discussion on photography beyond the framework established by the chronological analysis of stylistic development particular to the formation of the Western photographic canon, focussing instead on the function of these photographs. Lines of inquiry explored both in the exhibition and this catalogue evolve from the notion that photographs have and continue to play a role in how we see the world and therefore shape it: what do photographs do?</p>\n<p><em>Living Pictures</em> responds to five key themes that have emerged over the course of research, elaborated upon in detail in this catalogue by forerunners in the work on photography in Southeast Asia. Each section of this book, introduced by lead curator Charmaine Toh, illustrates the power and influence of photography: from its effect on the colonial imagination and formation of certain identities to present-day effects of the blitz of photographic images in our daily lives. The exhibition and catalogue both highlight the place of photography in art history, but as its title suggests, the changing uses of photographs—perhaps even the changing narrative of a single photograph—reveal their relevance to the way we see and interact with our world today.</p>\n<p>That the Gallery is actively rewriting the histories of global art through the perspective of Southeast Asian art histories is no small feat; unreserved thanks is given to our colleagues, including exhibition curators Roger Nelson, Goh Sze Ying, Roy Ng and Kenneth Tay, who are dedicated to uncovering these marginalised narratives that we hope will make a great impact on the art historical canon. We are also grateful to the individuals and institutions who have generously lent us their works for this display, allowing our publics this significant access.

Photography in South- east Asia has thus far been largely left out of both photographic and art histories, even those of its own nations. Ironically, this exclusion has allowed such photographs to “live” outside the established historical canons and so offer an opportunity to tell alternative histories. <em>Living Pictures: Photography in Southeast Asia</em> looks at the power of photography in affecting the way we see and approach the world, and its mobilisation n systems of knowledge and representation since it arrived in the region in the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century.</p>\n<p>This is not an attempt to draw regional or national boundaries, nor to identify a characteristic or style of photography, but to bring out certain practices and developments in this part of the world. As scholars increasingly recognise the need to address the dominance of Eurocentric histories and knowledge, the research for this exhibition offers an additional strand in the tapestry that is the global history of photography.</p>\n<p>In the attempt to take some tentative steps towards photography’s own history in this region, the curators of <em>Living Pictures</em> have consciously avoided the existing frameworks of photographic histories, particularly the Museum of Modern Art model, which is largely driven by stylistic developments in a reactive chronology.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> More generally, the way the exhibition has been organised eschews such formalist art historical categories of style and technique. Instead, the overarching question the exhibition asks is: what do photographs do? The search for answers has been productive. Photographs have lives—they move and they act—and in the process, they affect the world around them.</p>\n<p>By looking beyond the image, the exhibition draws out the conditions of production and reception of photography in Southeast Asia and the ways it has shaped the visual imaginary of the region, for itself and for others. <em>Living Pictures</em> is the culmination of the Gallery’s extensive research and collecting efforts in photography since we opened in 2015, when the medium was identified as a gap in our understanding of the histories of modern art in the region. As the first substantial survey of its kind, it highlights the important role photography has played in the development of visual culture and lays the groundwork for future research by others.</p>\n<p>As the most ubiquitous visual medium of the modern age, photography has had a tremendous impact on the way we see the world, and ourselves. The power of photography is deeply tied to a dis- course of “truth” and the history of its own development and use since its invention in France in 1839. Photography’s ability to capture a perfect, never- seen-before likeness was quickly appropriated by scientific and government agencies for use as documents, evidence and records. However, rather than thinking about photography as a reflection of the world, this exhibition asserts that photography has <em>shaped</em> our understanding of the world. <em>Living Pictures</em> reveals the roles photographs have played in imperialism and nationalism, in constructing and asserting modernities, and in challenging class and gender hierarchies. What is made visible and what is left out? And how does this change the way we engage not just with the image, but with the photographic object?</p>\n<h2>THE COLONIAL ARCHIVE</h2>\n<p>Early photography played an important role in visualising the world, and that included Southeast Asia. Photography’s history in Southeast Asia was closely linked to exploration, travel and its vaunted ability to accurately depict the world around it. The camera lent the explorer both status and credibility; it became a metaphor of objectivity. The earliest extant photograph made in Southeast Asia was Jules Itier’s (1802–1877) daguerreotype of the Thian Hock Keng temple in Singapore in 1844.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> The 1850s onwards saw a large number of itinerant European photographers travelling through parts of Southeast Asia. These travelling photographers typically spent a few months in one city providing their services before moving on to other nearby cities. They would then sell their works to illustrated magazines, publishers or even directly to customers, which included the European residents in the various Southeast Asian cities as well as the general public in Europe. This first section of the exhibition, “Colonial Archive,” recognises that many of the photographs made during this period resulted from European aims and desires. As such, they present a particular type of imperial gaze.</p>\n<p>In a lecture on photography and exploration to the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1891, John Thomson (1837–1921) claimed: “Where truth and all that is abiding are concerned, photography is absolutely trustworthy and the work now being done is a forecast of a future of great usefulness in every branch of science.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> Thomson was a Scottish photographer and one of the earliest to travel to Asia. He received significant recognition for this work, which brought images of the Far East to the audiences in Europe interested in finding out more about foreign lands and peoples. Thomson’s photo- graphs were shown in lectures as well as books and magazines, and of course sold to individuals who often assembled them in albums. Such photographs not only satisfied the curiosity of the European public but also played a crucial part in conveying the extent and power of their empires. This was supported by the belief in photography’s autonomy and neutrality.</p>\n<p>However, in his book <em>Picturing Empire</em>, James Ryan has demonstrated how the photo- graphs made for British consumption in the 19<sup>th</sup> century revealed</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“as much about the imaginative landscape of imperial culture as they do about the physical spaces or people pictured within their frame.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While Ryan’s book focused on the British Empire, this is equally true of images of the Dutch and French colonies. Consider the album owned by Charles McWhirter Mercer (1828–1884) with views of Punjab, Kashmir, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Penang, Singapore and Java. Within it are a large number of photographs of newly built infrastructure such as roads and buildings, all carefully composed to present visually pleasing scenes. Even the photographs of the countryside are picturesque landscapes, rather than untamed tropical jungles filled with wild beasts (<strong>see</strong> <cite class=\"quire-citation expandable\"><span class=\"quire-citation__button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-expanded=\"false\">pl. 37</span><span class=\"quire-citation__content\" hidden>John Thomson. <em>The Waterfall Penang</em>. c. 1876.

The images conveyed the civilising benefits of colonialism while also “domesticating a potentially hostile landscape.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup> They offered a deliberate balance of the foreign and the familiar.</p>\n<p>The photographic studio of G.R. Lambert &amp; Co. was also aware of what its customers wanted. Active in Singapore from 1867 till 1918, the studio had one of the largest catalogues of images—over 3,000 from different parts of Southeast Asia— including landscapes and images of people of various races, which sold extremely well to tourists and residents. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> It is important to note that the latter were not portraits in the traditional sense but were closer to ethnographic studies. Such photographs are described as “types” rather than “portraits” because the people in them were depicted as observed subjects rather than individual personalities. For example, the photograph of two Indian men had the caption of “Kling Washermen” and showed them posing with bags of laundry.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"\\_assets\\images\\figures\\pl-32.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-1\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 1</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">G.R.

Inherent to the production of the photographic image is the Janus-faced split between <em>showing</em> and <em>selecting</em>: an operation that has historically differentiated photography from painting. Unlike a painter, a photographer can never add a detail into the picture after the fact (unless manipulated in the darkroom or with software). This is the distinction between being <em>taken</em> and being <em>made</em>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> In spite of the photograph’s mimetic ability to depict reality—what Barthes terms as an “analogical perfection”—the photographic image flits furtively between exactitude and context.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> Visual details are cropped out in favour of compositional, ideological or cultural factors; nonetheless these decisions are often assumed as the photographer’s natural impulse to enhance the veracity of their subject.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> Photojournalism’s ur-hero Henri Cartier-Bresson equates the photographer’s flair as “the decisive moment,” an instance when a “satisfying” picture meets the revelation of “a truth about the subject.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> For Cartier-Bresson, the <em>decisive</em> appears to be simultaneously <em>discerning</em>: the photographer’s reflex manifests his technical virtuosity with the camera—a characteristic which separates the great from the average. Virtuosity very rarely discloses the intentions of the photojournalist, how the sum of their politics and prejudices shapes their coverage.</p>\n<p>When probed, we find our faith in the press photograph—of showing things and events as between image and text <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup>. In order for their objective and descriptive qualities to translate, even the most decisive photographs have generally relied on words before they can tell a thousand more. This assumed realism of the picture is in fact naturalised with the aid of captions, as Barthes outlines: “a press photograph is never without a written commentary.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> This essay centres upon the recuperative approaches taken by four artists in the <em>Living Pictures</em> exhibition which problematise representation and the circulation of the image, particularly those used in reportage. While each artist has a distinctive practice, in these selected works they share a similar interest in mining images found in mass media to draw out the complex relationship between photojournalism and its construction of history, and the way we see and understand the world.</p>\n<p>Photojournalism came to prominence in the 1930s as a result of the introduction of handheld cameras in the mid-1920s, which led to a rising popularity in illustrated essays in widely circulated picture magazines, such as <em>LIFE</em> and <em>Look</em> in the United States, and <em>Münchner Illustrierte</em> (Munich Illustrated) and <em>Vu</em> in Europe. Media magnate Henry Luce, who bought <em>LIFE</em> in 1936 and engineered its pictorial turn, articulated emphatically the publication’s maxim: “to see life; to see the world.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fnref7\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">7</a></sup> Luce knew that texts without pictures would sell fewer magazines, while photographs without captions failed to exploit the full spectrum of the reader’s imagination. At its height, <em>LIFE</em> reached one in three American readers; some of the most iconic images of the 20<sup>th</sup> century adorned its covers in the age preceding television. It is hard to ignore the fact that the demand for pictorial appeal, even in the venerated sphere of documentary photography, was largely shaped by market forces. Social theorist Susie Linfield aptly surmises that photography’s “original sin” lay in its supine relationship with consumerism. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fnref8\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">8</a></sup> In the 1960s, <em>LIFE</em> published various series of pictorial volumes, including the <em>LIFE World Library</em> anthology. This ambitious publication project took six years to complete, with an aim to “present a comprehensive interpretation of the principal nations and peoples of the contemporary world.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fnref9\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">9</a></sup> While the volume has been translated into 13 languages and circulated in over 90 countries, the majority of the writers are American and British. One of the editorial decisions for how the volumes are grouped is “its special relevance to American readers.” <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fnref10\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">10</a></sup> The criterion comes as no surprise given Luce, then editor-in-chief of <em>LIFE</em>, wrote in a 1941 editorial that “the American people are by far the best-informed people in the history of the world,” a not-too-audacious statement considering it coincided with the rising political dominance of the US. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fnref11\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">11</a></sup> <em>LIFE World Library</em> is an unabashed expression of the American view of the world, to the rest of world.</p>\n<p>In Simryn Gill’s (b. 1959) <em>32 Volumes</em> (<strong>see</strong> <cite class=\"quire-citation expandable\"><span class=\"quire-citation__button\" role=\"button\" tabindex=\"0\" aria-expanded=\"false\">pl. 287</span><span class=\"quire-citation__content\" hidden>Simryn Gill.<em>32 Volumes</em>. 2006.

The original titles and images on the hardcovers are painted over in gesso, while the printed text on the inside pages has been meticulously sandpapered away. The work serves up documentary photography in its most rudimentary form—a Barthesian purity of image without text—which in turn demonstrates the ambiguity that lurks behind every photograph. As with Gill’s other works, her interventions stem from her “fascination with the limit of rational knowledge, and with the instability of images and texts as forms of representation.”<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fnref12\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">12</a></sup> Gill obtained several sets of the anthology from a second-hand bookstore, a place that fits suitably with her compulsion for collecting. Objects and detritus often find their way into her personal radius, both fortuitously and with purpose: books, magazines, shrines, things washed up on the beach or crushed on the road, discarded and lost knick-knacks found on the street, fruit seeds and garden overgrowth. Gill gathers things to take them apart, alter or rearrange them, in a nebulous fashion that reveals <em>changefulness</em>, chipping away preordained ways of seeing the world. <sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fnref13\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">13</a></sup> Gill’s interventions with books speak more of her love for them—for reading and as objects—and from which her awareness of how the written word is imbricated in the power structures of problematic histories stems. It is as if she knows too well—and wants us to realise, too—that while representation is a function which reveals and clarifies the world, it is also the operation of how power begets power.</p>\n<div class=\"backmatter\">\n<h3>Endnotes</h3>\n</div>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>John Szarkowski, <em>The Photographer’s Eye</em> (New York: Museum of Modern Art, 2007), 9. <a href=\"#fnref1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">↩︎</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Roland Barthes, “The Photographic Message,” in <em>Image-Music-Text</em>, trans.
